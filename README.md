# backend-developer-challenge
For my submission to the Shopify Backend Challenge, I build this simple inventory tracking web application with Golang and Gin.

This app can perform the basic CRUD operations including:
* Create inventory items
* Edit inventory items
* Delete inventory items
* View a list of inventory items

For my additional feature, I added the ability to `push a button and export product data to a CSV`.
 
 

# To run the app:

* Download the code.
* Open your linux comand line
* Type `sudo apt install golang-go` to install go
* Use  `go run main.go` to run the app
* The interactions with the API can be made through Postman.
* You can also use `http://localhost:8080/item` to view existing items in the browser
